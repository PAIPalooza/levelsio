# Issue: Improve Test Documentation

## Description
Many tests lack proper BDD-style documentation and clear failure messages. Following SSCS standards, we need to enhance test documentation throughout the codebase to improve maintainability and readability.

## User Story (BDD)
**GIVEN** a test suite following SSCS standards  
**WHEN** reading test documentation and failure messages  
**THEN** the purpose and behavior of each test should be clearly understood

## Tasks
- [ ] Add GIVEN/WHEN/THEN documentation to all test classes and methods
- [ ] Improve assertion failure messages with descriptive context
- [ ] Create proper mocks for external dependencies
- [ ] Update test names to better reflect behavior being tested
- [ ] Standardize test fixture organization across modules

## Benefits
- Improved clarity for developers working with the tests
- Better understanding of test failures
- Consistency with SSCS standards
- Better test isolation with proper mocking
- More maintainable test suite

## Examples
Current:
```python
def test_calculate_ssim(self):
    result = self.evaluator.calculate_ssim(self.image1, self.image2)
    assert result > 0.7
```

Improved:
```python
def test_calculate_ssim(self):
    """
    GIVEN two similar images
    WHEN calculating SSIM between them
    THEN the similarity score should be high (>0.7)
    """
    result = self.evaluator.calculate_ssim(self.image1, self.image2)
    assert result > 0.7, f"SSIM score {result} is too low, expected >0.7"
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests have BDD-style documentation
- Assertion failures provide clear context
- External dependencies use proper mocking
- Test names clearly indicate behavior being tested
- Documentation follows SSCS standards with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format

## Effort Estimate
Story points: 3 (Medium complexity)

# Interior Style Transfer API: Test Failures Report

## Overview
This document outlines test failures identified in the project and categorizes them into actionable chores following SSCS guidelines.

## Test Execution Summary
- Total Tests: 294
- Passed: 197 (67%)
- Failed: 70 (24%)
- Skipped: 11 (4%)
- Expected Failures: 13 (4%)
- Unexpected Passes: 2 (1%)
- Errors: 1 (<1%)

## Key Failure Categories

### 1. Private Method Access Issues
Several tests attempt to access private methods in the `SegmentationHandler` class that are not directly accessible:

```
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_verify_checkpoint
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_download_checkpoint_patched
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_heuristic_segmentation
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_simple_edge_detection
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_process_sam_masks
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_blend_with_mask
```

### 2. API Testing Issues
Multiple API tests are failing with status code or response format issues:

```
FAILED tests/test_api.py::TestAPIBasics::test_api_root
FAILED tests/test_api_comprehensive.py::TestAPIComprehensive::test_health_check
FAILED tests/test_style_transfer_high_risk.py::TestStyleTransferOptions::test_valid_style_options
FAILED tests/test_style_transfer_high_risk.py::TestStyleTransferOptions::test_custom_prompt_overrides_style
```

### 3. Missing Fixtures
One test has missing fixtures:

```
ERROR tests/test_api_workflow.py::test_evaluation_endpoint - fixture 'original_image' not found
```

### 4. Interface Changes
Tests failing due to interface changes in methods:

```
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_public.py::TestSegmentationPublicInterfaces::test_apply_mask - TypeError: SegmentationHandler.apply_mask() got an unexpected keyword argument
```

## Recommended Chores

Based on the identified failures, I recommend creating the following chores in order of priority:

1. **Fix Segmentation Handler Tests**
   - Review and adapt private method tests to use public interfaces
   - Update tests to reflect current method signatures
   
2. **Fix API Integration Tests**
   - Address API endpoint response status code issues
   - Fix fixture setup for workflow tests
   
3. **Update Style Transfer Tests**
   - Fix failing style transfer options tests
   - Address custom prompt handling tests
   
4. **Reconcile Interface Changes**
   - Update all calls to `apply_mask` to match new method signature
   - Ensure consistent method signatures across all API endpoints

5. **Improve Test Documentation**
   - Add BDD-style documentation to all tests following SSCS
   - Create mocks for external dependencies to improve test stability

These chores follow the Semantic Seed Coding Standards by focusing on code quality, security, and BDD principles.

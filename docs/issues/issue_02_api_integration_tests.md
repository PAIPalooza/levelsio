# Issue: Resolve API Integration Test Failures

## Description
Multiple API integration tests are failing with status code mismatches and missing fixtures. Following SSCS standards, we need to fix these tests to ensure proper API validation and reliability.

## User Story (BDD)
**GIVEN** a need to validate our API endpoints  
**WHEN** running integration tests following SSCS standards  
**THEN** all tests should pass with appropriate fixtures and status codes

## Tasks
- [ ] Fix missing `original_image` fixture in `test_api_workflow.py`
- [ ] Resolve status code mismatches in `test_style_transfer_high_risk.py`
- [ ] Address failing API basic tests in `test_api.py`
- [ ] Fix comprehensive API tests in `test_api_comprehensive.py`
- [ ] Add proper BDD-style documentation to all API tests

## Failing Tests
```
ERROR tests/test_api_workflow.py::test_evaluation_endpoint - fixture 'original_image' not found
FAILED tests/test_style_transfer_high_risk.py::TestStyleTransferOptions::test_valid_style_options - assert 500 == 200
FAILED tests/test_style_transfer_high_risk.py::TestStyleTransferOptions::test_custom_prompt_overrides_style - assert 500 == 200
FAILED tests/test_api.py::TestAPIBasics::test_api_root
FAILED tests/test_api_comprehensive.py::TestAPIComprehensive::test_health_check
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API integration tests pass successfully
- API fixtures are properly defined and reusable
- Status codes match expected responses
- Documentation follows SSCS standards with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- No regression in existing functionality

## Effort Estimate
Story points: 3 (Medium complexity)

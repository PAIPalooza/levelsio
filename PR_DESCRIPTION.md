Improve test coverage for segmentation and evaluation modules

## Description
This PR adds comprehensive test coverage for the segmentation and evaluation modules, improving overall project test coverage from 79% to 83%, exceeding industry standards.

## Changes Made
- Created `test_segmentation_public.py` with BDD-style tests focused on public interfaces
- Created `test_evaluation_public.py` with BDD-style tests focused on public interfaces
- Dramatically improved the segmentation module coverage from 66% to 81%
- Improved evaluation module coverage to 77%
- Used proper mocking for display/visualization components
- Added environment variable support with `.env` and `.env.example` files

## Test Coverage By Module
- `models.py`: 100% (Perfect coverage)
- `generation.py`: 97% (Near-perfect coverage)  
- `flux_integration.py`: 87% (Excellent coverage)
- `data_model.py`: 85% (Excellent coverage)
- `style_transfer.py`: 85% (Excellent coverage)
- `segmentation.py`: 81% (Very good coverage, major improvement)
- `evaluation.py`: 77% (Good coverage)

## Related Issues
Closes #11 - Write unit and integration tests

## Testing Instructions
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Run the full test suite: `python -m pytest`
3. Check coverage report: `python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report term-missing`

## Additional PR Information
### PR: Complete API Integration with Fal.ai

#### Description
Completed the integration of the Interior Style Transfer API with the Fal.ai service, ensuring all endpoints work correctly in the complete workflow.

#### Changes Made
- Fixed style transfer endpoint to correctly use `apply_style_only` method
- Added image resizing functionality to handle dimension mismatches
- Updated segmentation endpoint to use `visualize_masks` instead of `visualize_mask`
- Enhanced evaluation endpoint to support both `styled_image` and `stylized_image` field names
- Added missing `generate_difference_visualization` method for evaluation comparisons
- Made request models more flexible to handle various client implementations
- Improved error handling throughout the API
- Added comprehensive documentation

#### Test Results
All three API endpoints now pass the full workflow test:
- Style Transfer: PASSED
- Segmentation: PASSED
- Evaluation: PASSED

### PR: Final QA - Code Comments, Structure, and SSCS Compliance

#### Description
Conducted comprehensive review of codebase to ensure compliance with Semantic Seed Coding Standards, improving documentation and code organization.

#### Changes Made
- Added BDD-style docstrings with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- Standardized variable naming conventions to camelCase
- Made error response format consistent across API
- Improved parameter descriptions in docstrings
- Created comprehensive QA review document
- Fixed line length issues to meet 80-character limit
- Followed SSCS guidelines for code organization

#### Test Coverage By Module
- Overall project coverage: 83% (Exceeding the 80% target)
- All critical modules now meet or exceed coverage requirements

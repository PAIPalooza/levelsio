# PR: Complete API Integration with Fal.ai

## Story Summary
Completed the integration of the Interior Style Transfer API with the Fal.ai service, ensuring all endpoints work correctly in the complete workflow.

## Changes Made
- Fixed style transfer endpoint to correctly use `apply_style_only` method
- Added image resizing functionality to handle dimension mismatches
- Updated segmentation endpoint to use `visualize_masks` instead of `visualize_mask`
- Enhanced evaluation endpoint to support both `styled_image` and `stylized_image` field names
- Added missing `generate_difference_visualization` method for evaluation comparisons
- Made request models more flexible to handle various client implementations
- Improved error handling throughout the API
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Test Results
All three API endpoints now pass the full workflow test:
- Style Transfer: ✅ PASSED
- Segmentation: ✅ PASSED
- Evaluation: ✅ PASSED

## Documentation
- Created detailed API documentation in `docs/api_integration.md`
- Added sprint completion report in `docs/sprint_completion.md`

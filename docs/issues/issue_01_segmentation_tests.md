# Issue: Fix Segmentation Handler Test Accessibility

## Description
Several tests are failing due to attempts to access private methods in the `SegmentationHandler` class. Following SSCS standards, we need to refactor these tests to properly respect encapsulation while maintaining test coverage.

## User Story (BDD)
**GIVEN** a need to test private methods in the `SegmentationHandler` class  
**WHEN** writing tests following SSCS standards  
**THEN** we should use public interfaces or appropriate test mocks

## Tasks
- [ ] Review failing tests in `test_segmentation_extended.py` and `test_segmentation_private.py`
- [ ] Refactor tests to use public methods or appropriate test strategies
- [ ] Ensure all methods have proper accessibility modifiers (public, protected, private)
- [ ] Add BDD-style documentation to all tests
- [ ] Verify test coverage remains above 80%

## Failing Tests
```
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_verify_checkpoint
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_download_checkpoint_patched
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_heuristic_segmentation
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_simple_edge_detection
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_process_sam_masks
FAILED tests/test_segmentation_extended.py::TestSegmentationHandlerExtended::test_blend_with_mask
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests pass without directly accessing private methods
- Test coverage for `segmentation.py` remains at or above 81%
- Documentation follows SSCS standards with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- No changes to production code behavior

## Effort Estimate
Story points: 3 (Medium complexity)
